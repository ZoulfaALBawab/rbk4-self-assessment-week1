* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.

## Stack : 
It works by rule : "LIFO : Last I/P ,, First O/P" ..
like when i have an array and the last element i push for the array will be the first element i have to delete it from .. 
Ex. : like a group of diches ,, the last i put it in the top ,, the first one i will take ..   

## Queue :
It works by rule : "FIFO : First I/P ,, First O/P" .. 
Now the first element i will add to an array or Obj. "It is only ex." the first element i will delete .. 
Ex. I can use method in real life like how the people will be when they want to bye coffe ,, So the first person came ,, the first one will have coffe ..
